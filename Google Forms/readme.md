# Google Forms xAPI

This project's code is to be added as a **Google Apps Script**, which is accessible in a Google Form by selecting *Script Editor* in the Edit menu.

The file format is properly `.gs`, but it's basically JavaScript so it's saved as `.js` here for easier code editing. It can then be copy/pasted into the Script Editor for execution.
