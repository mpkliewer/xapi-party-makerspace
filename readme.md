# xAPI Cohort MakerSpace Archive

This is an archive of the code that has been produced during various instances of the **xAPI Cohort MakerSpace**, which is a concurrent "session" / hackathon that takes place at the end of each xAPI Cohort during the **xAPI Party**.

## Disclaimer

Each folder should have its own `readme.md` file with at least basic information and/or instructions.

The code is provided as-is - sometimes it's tied to certain elements that don't exist anymore, require external accounts or the documentation is scant (since it was assembled in an afternoon).

Feel free to fork/clone/etc.
